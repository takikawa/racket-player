This is a music player written in Racket.

At the moment, it doesn't do much other than play whatever music
and video files are supported by GStreamer. The GUI is very primitive
so far.

The main intention of this project is to demonstrate that this can be
done and also for practicing my Racket-fu. Eventually, I intend to
develop this into a useful media player alternative.

===============================================================================

I recommend that you use the gr2 branch of Racket to run this. The gr2 branch
seems to interact with the gstreamer bindings better.

To run:
racket player.rkt

or
gracket player.rkt (if not using gr2)

===============================================================================

Required libraries:
libtagc
libgstreamer-0.10
and their dependencies
